This build is the culmination of over a month and a half of work, the brunt of which was completed in September. The original deadline had been set for the end of September, but a few days before the 30th, Bandai officially announced that they had extended the submission deadline to Halloween. This gave me time to add the floating cable effects and fine-tune the shrapnel. In total, parts from 7 different model kits have gone into the creation of this build.
